# ðŸŒœ LunaTracker ðŸŒ›

LunaTracker is a newborn baby tracking app.

Parenting can be tough. You get home from the hospital, exhausted, with this little fragile unknown thingy that has no user manual and a single way to let you know something's not ok: crying.
You have to react fast, event if it's 4 AM and you have no idea why is crying.

This app is meant to log all the relevant events (diaper change, breastfeeding, baby bottle feeding...), so you can always remember when has been done last time. It supports syncing the data between different devices (using your WebDAV server for the best privacy) so that when the baby needs attentions, the dad can step in leaving the mom sleeping peacefully.

Dedicated to my daughter Luna.
